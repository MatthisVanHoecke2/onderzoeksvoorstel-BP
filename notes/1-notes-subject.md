# Phase 1. Formulating a research question

## Effectiveness of AI-Enabled Behavioral Analysis vs. Human Diagnosis in Depression Screening

1. ### Research objective

   The research objective of comparing the success rate of AI-enabled behavioral analysis and human diagnosis in mental health screening would be to determine which method is more effective in accurately identifying individuals who may have mental health conditions.

2. ### Research question

   Is AI-enabled behavioral analysis more accurate than human diagnosis in mental health screening?

3. ### Target group

   The target group for the research would be mental health professionals, researchers, and individuals interested in mental health screening.

   Mental health professionals could benefit from understanding the strengths and limitations of AI-enabled behavioral analysis and how it compares to their own diagnosis.

   Researchers could use the findings to inform the development of AI-based mental health screening tools and to further investigate the potential of AI in mental health.

   Individuals interested in mental health screening, including patients, families, and caregivers, could benefit from understanding the accuracy and reliability of different methods of mental health screening.

   Ultimately, the target group would be anyone who has a vested interest in improving mental health screening and care.
