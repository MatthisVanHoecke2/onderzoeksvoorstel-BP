Abstract:
Due to the rise in reported cases of people with a depressive disorder, it has become necessary to develop new methods for diagnosing this disorder. This may be accomplished using behaviour-analysis AI.

This research aims to compare diagnoses of psychiatrists with AI-performed diagnoses. Specifically, it investigates whether the AI can accurately deduce the mental state of a patient suffering from the depressive disorder.

To conclude whether this is achievable, a group of volunteers were selected to be individually examined by multiple professionals, as well as by the AI. The professionals' most frequently diagnosed condition was used to ascertain the correct diagnosis, after which the professional’s individual diagnosis were compared the AI’s diagnosis to determine its accuracy.

The results indicated that AI could accurately determine the mental state of each subject with a high degree of precision. These results suggest AI has the potential to be more accurate than certain psychological professionals.
