This Github-repository contains all the necessary information you need to prepare and write the paper for the subject Research Methods.

The exam grade will be entirely based on this paper, making it important to follow the instructions meticulously. By dividing your work into different phases with specific targets, hopefully you will manage to reach the required targets. Below a short overview of the different phases, each with a link to a more specific explanation.

1. [Subject choice](instructions/1-subject.md)
2. [Work environment setup](instructions/2-environment.md)
3. [Consulting literature](instructions/3-literature.md)
4. [Literature study](instructions/4-bibliography.md)
5. [Methodology](instructions/5-methodology.md)
6. [Paper wrapup](instructions/6-final.md)

Estimation is two weeks work for each phase. Most work is probably in phase 4. If you plan this beforehand, you will not encounter any surprises at the end of the semester when deadlines need to be met (for other assignments or projects too)!

the directory [notes](notes/) contains a few Markdown files you can use to write down some notes. We added some examples, but feel free to make some new ones. 

The directory [paper](paper/) contains the LaTeX source code for the research proposal paper for a bachelor thesis, subject to this assignment. 
The file `SurnameFirstnameYearRM.tex` needs renaming to your own name and year before you start editing it. The file `bibliografie.bib` is a bibliographic database that you can open and edit using JabRef. When you intend to use images in your paper, please save them in the `img/` subdirectory.
