# Phase 1. Formulating a research question

The assignment in this phase is easily described, but hard to carry out!

- Find a subject within ICT that you think is suitable for writing a bachelor thesis in computer science.
    - Are you also taking the bachelor's thesis this year? Then you may also use your thesis subject for this assignment. The template (l.60 and following) provides that you also state this explicitly.
- Formulate a research question and any sub-questions. Apply the principles of S.M.A.R.T. objectives!
- Write these down in the appropriate file `notes/1-notes-subject.md`
- When you have made a final choice, you can write the abstract of the paper in the same file. In a next phase you will develop this further in LaTeX.
