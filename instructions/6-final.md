# Stap 6. Finishing up

Finish the paper completely!

- Complete the text and make sure you have all required sections present.
- Write an abstract. Make sure that your abstract is **no introduction**, but synthesizes the *whole text*.
- Check for all TODO's in the comments of the LaTeX document. If a TODO is finished, remove the comment!
- Perform a thorough check of the final version of your manuscript(PDF), both for form (margins, pictures, references, bibliography, ...) and content (language errors, writing style, ...).
- Ensure that the last revision of all files in the repository have been committed and synchronised with Github!
- Submit the manuscript **timely** on the Chamilo platform, in the assignment section!
