# Phase 3. Consult professional literature

In the previous phase you have chosen a subject. The idea now is to find as much relevant information about that subject. 

- Search in professional literature for reliable information sources related to the subject of your choice. 
- Write all necessary information needed to retrieve your source back again later in the file `notes/3-notes-literature.md`. At least keep the full title, author and year of publication together with the URL where you can find more information about the source (or the text itself). At this moment, this information should not be structured properly, we will come back to that later. Write down your most important findings, what you have learnt from the source and/or why you decided to keep the source. 
- Make sure you have a wide diversity in the nature of your sources!
    - a book or manual
    - An article in a scientific or professional journal 
    - A video of a presentation on a conference
    - A blog article by an expert
    - Not only Dutch (if your bachelor thesis is written in Dutch of course), but also and mainly English sources 
    - ...
- Develop a critical attitude! Do your sources pass the [CRAAP-test](https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/bestanden/829924/hbo-ict%20craap%20test.pdf or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAAP_test)?
